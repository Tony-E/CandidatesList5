# CandidatesList5
CandidatesList5 collects data related to asteroid tracking.
It downloads lists of asteroids from the Minor Planet Center and European Space Agency websites and works out 
which ones might be visible and interesting to observe from the Slooh.com robotic telescopes.
A local copy of the MPCORB.DAT asteroid database is required.
